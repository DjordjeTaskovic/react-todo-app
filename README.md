## Basic Functionalities
This to-do app covers some basic functionalities commonly found in React applications:
-Component-Based Structure: The app is structured using components, such as App, TodoList, and TodoItem, to promote code reusability and maintainability.
-State Management: React state is used to manage the to-do items' data and their statuses.
-User Interactions: The app responds to user interactions by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and mark to-do items as complete. React event handling is used for this.
-Conditional Rendering: To filter to-do items by status (All, Active, Completed), conditional rendering is implemented.
-Local Storage: The app uses local storage to persist the to-do list between page refreshes.
-Routing (optional): You can extend this app by adding routing with react-router-dom to navigate between different views, like a detailed view for each to-do item.
